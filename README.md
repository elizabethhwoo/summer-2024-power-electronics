## Objective 
To apply the course theory to design, implement and analyze a relevant device or a system

## Project Requirements 
1. The project must be completed using MATLAB/Simulink/Simscape Power Systems. Analytical hand
calculation may be used for analyses and for presenting the results in the project report.

<ins>1) Design of a device or a system</ins>
* Design a device or a system that is based on one of the device/systems covered in the course. They include
DC-DC converters, DC power supplies, rectifier, inverter, and HVDC transmission system. The main
requirements are as follows:
- Parameters: The device/system must be appropriate/realistic where all pertinent parameters
must be specified. It is preferable that parameters of a real-world device/system are used.
References (e.g. publications, online sources, manufacturer data etc.) must be provided if you
use data from the sources. The device/system pertinent parameters shall be provided in a table
similar to the Table 1 below.
- A circuit diagram for the designed device/system must be drawn and included in the report. 
- Rationale must be provided to justify the design (e.g. the need for the device/system, its benefit,
its applications, reason/rule of thumb for parameter selection etc.)
- Output calculation: Using the system design parameters, calculate its pertinent outputs to
confirm that desired outputs are obtained. Include all the calculations and results in the report.
